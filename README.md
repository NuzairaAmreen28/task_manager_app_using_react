Task Manager Application is a CRUD based project using HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.
In this application we can add the tasks to be done along with day and time.
Once the task is completed it can be deleted from the list of tasks to be done.
Also we can make any changes to the task details as per our requirement.
As soon as a new task is created, it is shown on the screen along with previous tasks for the user to view.
